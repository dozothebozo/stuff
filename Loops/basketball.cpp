// Basketball Player Streaks
// Write a program that analyzes recent game scoring for a basketball team.
//
// Rules and Specifications:
// 1) Ask the user for the number of players they want to analyze. This
//    will control your outer loop.
// 2) For each player, prompt for their points scored in their last 5 games.
//    Use an inner loop to collect these 5 scores.
// 3) Calculate and display the player's average points over those 5 games.
// 4) Count and display how many of those games were "high scoring" games
//    where the player scored 20 or more points.
//
// Example:
//
// Computer: How many players to analyze?
// User: 2
// Computer: Enter scores for Player 1:
// User: 15 22 18 25 30
// Computer: Player 1 Average: 22.0. High scoring games: 3
// Computer: Enter scores for Player 2:
// User: 10 12 15 8 11
// Computer: Player 2 Average: 11.2. High scoring games: 0
