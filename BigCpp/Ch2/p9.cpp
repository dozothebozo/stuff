// Implement a program that directs a cashier how to
// give change. The program has two inputs: the amount due and the amount
// received from the customer. It should compute the difference, and compute the
// dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies that the customer should
// receive in return. Hint: First transform the difference into an integer
// balance, denominated in pennies. Then compute the whole dollar amount.
// Subtract it from the balance. Compute the number of quarters needed. Repeat
// for dimes and nickels. Display the remaining pennies.
