// A year with 366 days is called a leap year.
//
// Rules:
// A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4.
// BUT it is NOT a leap year if it is divisible by 100.
// HOWEVER, it IS a leap year if it is divisible by 400.
// Before October 15, 1582 (Gregorian calendar),
// there were no exceptions, so any year divisible by 4 was a leap year.
//
// Write a program that:
// Asks the user for a year.
// Determines whether it is a leap year.
// Uses a single if statement.
//
// Example:
//
// Computer: Enter a year:
// User: 2000
// Computer: 2000 is a leap year.
//
// Computer: Enter a year:
// User: 1900
// Computer: 1900 is not a leap year.
