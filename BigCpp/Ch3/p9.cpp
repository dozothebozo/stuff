// Write a program that reads in the name and salary of an employee,
// asks how many hours they worked in the past week, and computes their pay.
//
// Rules and Specifications:
// 1) The salary denotes an hourly wage.
// 2) The program must be able to accept fractional hours worked (e.g., 42.5).
// 3) Regular hourly wage applies to hours worked up to and including 40 hours.
// 4) Any overtime work (hours strictly greater than 40) is paid at 150 percent
//    of the regular wage.
// 5) The program must print a paycheck summary for the employee.
//
// Example:
//
// Computer: Enter employee name:
// User: Jane Smith
// Computer: Enter hourly wage:
// User: 10.00
// Computer: Enter hours worked in the past week:
// User: 45.5
// Computer: Paycheck for Jane Smith: $482.50
